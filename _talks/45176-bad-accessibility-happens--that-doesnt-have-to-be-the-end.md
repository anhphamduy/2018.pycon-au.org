abstract: "Avoidance is not the answer\u2014bad accessibility will still be there,\
  \ losing you users and creating bad will. We\u2019ll go through examples of what\
  \ not to do and how to fix problems. We\u2019ll also talk about compromises that\
  \ can be made to appease stakeholders and others."

## Overview
This talk will go through accessibility concerns on the web through example of bad accessibility, teaching the audience about the struggles of many types of users on the web. We will cover well-known concerns such as low vision/color blindness, as well as attention issues and anxiety, and discuss the limitations and abilities of some alternative input and output. Quick fixed and long-term considerations will be discussed, with the overall goal being that the participants leave knowing how to find and solve accessibility problems.

## Why Bother With Accessibility
Not only should you want everyone to be able to easily use your site, but having an accessible website comes with a variety of benefits. 

Most countries and NGOs put the  amount of disabled people in a population at anywhere from 10-20%, which is a massive amount of users to gain (or lose). Accessible web designs tends to lead to better UX and a happier user base and it will save devs time and frustration when they're working with the code, since good HTML is enforced.

This talk will help the audience get into the mindset necessary for finding ways to immediately improve sites. Everyone should leave with ideas on what parts of their sites to start looking into for potential accessibility concerns and with knowledge of some tools that will assist them with their improvements. 

## Who This Talk Is For
The audience will be expected to have working knowledge of the internet, webpages, and using webpages.
